# Capstone Project

In this project I implemented generating trajectory with desired speeds (to minimize acceleration and jerk) based on given waypoints. Using information about the current state of traffic lights from the simulator, the car was able to stop and wait for the green light. Controls (steering angle, throttle, brake) were calculated from the trajectory and sent to the simulated car.
